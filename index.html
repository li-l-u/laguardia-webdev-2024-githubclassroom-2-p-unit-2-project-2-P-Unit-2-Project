    <h3>Historic Landmarks</h3>
    <p>
      Italy's preservation of <em class="import"> historic monuments </em>is
      well known. Like the giant colosseum that was built almost 2000 years ago.

    <h3>Explore and Enjoy the Local Arts</h3>

      On the streets, you will see vendors selling and showcasing several forms
      of their art. Consider buying one of their one-of-a-kind works for a
      <em class="import">memorable souvenir.</em><br /><br />
      In the wonderful city of Florence, you can also explore the expansive
      wineyards and grape farms, trying your hand at wine tasting
      <em class="funny">(if you are of legal age haha).</em>

    <h3>And of Course, Eat the Food!</h3>
    <p>
      <em class="import"> Cuisine </em>is the highlight of most trips, and Italy
      is
      <em class="funny"
        >definitly not lacking in this department either!<br
